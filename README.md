# Monte Carlo Resampling For Multiple Effect Testing
This code was used in analysis of dose response lethality data. Monte Carlo resampling was used to determine if the response between two different treatment types was statistically significant. 

This study was conducted using the estuarine model fish species, Inland silverside (Menidia beryllina), from less than 24 hours post fertilization to four days post hatch (12 days total exposure). We tested the biocides bifenthrin, chlorpyrifos, dicloran, myclobutanil, paraquat, penconcazole, and triadimefon. 

The aim of this study was to determine if toxicity differed at different exposure salinities. Therefore, we exposed the fish to the seven biocides at two different salinities, 5PSU and 15PSU. 

This was a range finding project where the concentration at which 50% and 10% (LC50 and LC10) of the organisms experienced mortality was calculated. This code was used to determine if the LC50 LC10 values derived were significantly different (p value less than or equal to 0.05) or different by random chance.
